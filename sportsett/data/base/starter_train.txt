Thompson , on the other hand , finished with 19 points ( 7 - 18 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds over 36 minutes .
Thompson shot less than 40 percent from the field in three of his last four games coming into this one , so it was a step in the right direction Monday with his performance .
Thomas Robinson and Jakaar Sampson finished in double figures off the bench .
Robinson posted 12 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) and six rebounds , while Sampson had 10 points ( 3 - 8 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds .
