Charlotte has won four straight games , and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule ( Sixers , Jazz , Nuggets , Bucks ) , the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance Stephenson ( groin ) sitting out as the reason for the Hornets ' success .
Stephenson has missed the last four games , coinciding with the Hornets ' resurgence , and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late , putting all the blame on one player is misleading .

They gave up most of their lead in the second quarter but had enough to hang on for the win .
Jeff Teague paced the team with a game - high 25 points in 37 minutes , indicating that he is probably over his hamstring injury .

Hibbert went 6 - for - 11 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the free throw line to score 18 points , while also adding seven rebounds .

Crowder on the other hand posted 22 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , three assists , four steals and two blocks .
While the 22 points were a season - high for him , so were the blocks and steals , as he was a huge contributor on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball Monday .
The Celtics did receive plenty of help from their bench as well .
Marcus Thornton had 13 points ( 2 - 8 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) in only 14 minutes , while Brandon Bass had 12 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) in 23 minutes .

Eric Gordon had arguably his best game of the season , going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 21 points .
It was a season - high in points for him , as he 's dealt with injuries for a large portion of the year .
Coming off the bench with Gordon back in the starting lineup , Tyreke Evans still had a strong showing .
He chipped in with 19 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and eight rebounds , playing just under 35 minutes because Jrue Holiday was forced from the game after only 15 minutes with a right ankle injury .

When Atlanta 's Mike Scott jammed an alley oop home to put the Hawks up 79 - 65 in the fourth , it looked like this was going to be another easy win for the top team in the East .
However , the Celtics made an unbelievable push to storm back .
Boston called on Evan Turner on inbounds play with six seconds left and Turner hit a floater to give the Celtics the lead with under a second remaining .

Jared Sullinger shook off a rough first half to finish the night with 17 points and 15 rebounds .

Tyler Zeller converted a buzzer - beater under the hoop to give Boston the win .

It was the Celtics who came out with the last laugh though , as Jae Crowder hit a clutch jump shot with just under a second left in regulation to pull out the victory .
It was a solid victory for the Celtics , as they 're now going to go into the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern_Conference standings , meaning they 'll take on the Cleveland Cavaliers during the first round .
The Raptors , on the other hand , moved down into the fourth seed in the East , a game behind the Chicago Bulls , which would mean they could end up playing the fiffth - seeded Washington Wizards in their first playoff matchup .
It was the duo of Avery Bradley and Evan Turner that had the biggest impact in securing the win Tuesday .
Turner nearly came out with a triple - double , finishing with 14 points ( 7 - 14 FG ) , seven rebounds and nine assists .
It was n't all good for the forward though , as he did record seven turnovers as well .
He 's combined for 29 points and 14 assists over his last two games , and he 'll need to continue to play well if the Celtics want any chance at pulling off an upset during the playoffs .
Bradley recorded 14 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) of his own , to go along with three rebounds and two assists , but he ended up suffering a left quad contusion and was forced to leave the game .
He 'll likely sit Wednesday 's finale out in order to get healthy for their first playoff matchup .
Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller were the other two starters in double figures .
Bass finished with 13 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and nine rebounds , while Zeller added 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and eight rebounds .
For the Raptors , Kyle Lowry went 6 - for - 20 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to match a team - high of 16 points , while also recording six rebounds and four assists .
Lowry has really struggled with his shot lately , combining to go just 9 - for - 34 from the field over his last two games , so he really needs to get things turned around if the Raptors want to have some success in the playoffs .
Despite struggling with his shot similar to Lowry , Louis Williams still posted 16 points ( 3 - 13 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt ) , as he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times , while converting on 10 - of - 11 .
Williams continues to be a great offensive option off the Raptors ' bench , averaging 21 points over his last six games .
Jonas Valanciunas nearly came up with a double - double , posting 10 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) , eight rebounds and two blocked shots , while Greivis Vasquez chipped in with 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) , five rebounds and seven assists .

The Los_Angeles Clippers defeated the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 0 - 2 ) 93 - 90 on Thursday at the Staples_Center in Los_Angeles .
Russell Westbrook left the game in the first quarter with a broken right hand and did not return to the game .
It is unclear how long Westbrook will be out with the injury , but some reports suggested he could miss a few as two weeks .
With Kevin Durant already sidelined due to foot surgery for at least the first month of the season , the Thunder are in danger of digging a hole to start their season that may be too deep to crawl out of and reach the playoffs in the Western_Conference .
In addition to Durant , the Thunder are also dealing with injuries to Anthony Morrow , Mitch McGary , Jeremy Lamb , Grant Jerrett , and Reggie Jackson .
They may only have eight healthy players for their next game if no one returns to action Saturday against the Denver Nuggets .
The Clippers could n't create much separation from Oklahoma_City despite all of the injuries the Thunder are dealing with .
Spencer Hawes was brought in this offseason to help shore up the Clippers ' frontcourt depth by giving them a versatile shooter off the bench .
It was expected Hawes might carve out a big enough role to steal some minutes from starters Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan , but that was n't the case in the opener as Hawes played just 19 minutes off the bench , while Griffin played 38 and Jordan played 35 .
The Clippers finish off a back - to - back set to start the season on Friday when they play Lakers .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 5 - 3 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 5 - 5 ) 120 - 107 on Saturday .

Phoenix was playing the second night of a back - to - back , coming off a loss at home to the Charlotte Hornets .
