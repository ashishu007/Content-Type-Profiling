Portland ( 39 - 26 ) and OKC ( 40 - 25 ) entered the game tied for third in the Western_Conference , making it a key game for both teams . Thursday 's matchup lived up to its potential with a wild overtime finish . Regulation finished in memorable fashion , with Portland narrowly succeeding in forcing OT . Oklahoma_City took the lead when , with only 13 seconds left , Terrance Ferguson scored on a put - back layup after a collision between Paul George and Jusuf Nurkic . Tensions began to flare after the referees declined to review the incident . With tempers still running high , Nurkic drew a foul with 4 seconds remaining in regulation , but immediately picked up a technical foul after another dust - up with George . The tech was his second of the game , leading to an ejection . With Nurkic unable to shoot his free - throws , the Thunder elected to have Portland 's Skal Labissiere take the shots in his stead . Labissiere missed both shots , but Markieff Morris committed a loose ball foul that sent Al-Faroq Aminu to the line to tie the game and send it to overtime . Overtime , though , proved to be less exhilarating as the Thunder quickly began to run away with the game . Russell Westbrook scored eight of the team 's overtime points , including three on free - throws . OKC was able to exploit Nurkic 's absence and attack the rim with success in OT . Westbrook finished with a team - high 37 points . Fellow All-Star Paul George also had a big contribution , scoring 32 points while grabbing 14 rebounds . For Portland , star point guard Damian Lillard delivered a season - high 51 points . Lillard was wildly efficient , shooting 15 - of - 28 from the field and 18 - of - 20 at the free - throw line . However , it was not enough to pick up the win , as the Trail_Blazers shot just 39 percent overall from the field en route to the late - season loss . The Thunder will visit Los_Angeles to take on the Clippers on Friday , while Portland will play host to the Phoenix Suns on Saturday .
