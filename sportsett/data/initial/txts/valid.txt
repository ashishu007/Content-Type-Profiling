Andre Drummond was phenomenal for the Pistons , scoring 26 points on 10 - of - 12 shooting from the field to go along with 22 rebounds , six assists and four steals . Tobias Harris continued his great 2017 - 18 campaign , scoring a game - high 31 points and grabbing eight rebounds , while Reggie Jackson scored 20 points of his own and dished out seven assists . As a team , the Pistons shot a scorching 44 percent from behind the arc and 52 percent from the field overall . Unsurprisingly , for the Celtics , it was their worst defensive performance of the season by far , with the league 's top scoring defense gave up a season - high 118 points . Boston still had a great shooting night , shooting an impressive 16 - of - 33 ( 48 percent ) from three and 52 percent from the field overall , but the Celtics committed 17 turnovers and shot just 12 - of - 21 from the free throw line . Marcus Smart came off the bench and did everything he could to keep his team in the game , shooting 6 - of - 9 from behind the arc en route to scoring a team - high 23 points in 32 minutes , but ultimately it was not enough .

The Utah Jazz defeated the Boston Celtics , 107 - 95 , at TD_Garden on Friday evening . The Jazz ( 14 - 15 ) came into Friday 's game looking to snap a four - game losing streak , although a road matchup against a tough Celtics ( 24 - 7 ) certainly did n't bode well for their chances of doing so . Matters then took a turn for the worse during the contest , as Rudy Gobert went down in the first quarter after teammate Derrick Favors rolled up on his left knee . Favors eventually exited the contest with his own injury , as he suffered a facial laceration that required six stitches .

The Boston Celtics defeated the visiting Brooklyn Nets , 108 - 105 , at TD_Garden on Sunday evening . The Celtics ( 30 - 10 ) were massive favorites ahead of this game , but they had to work harder than expected against a hard - working Nets ( 13 - 23 ) team that made things quite complicated for Boston . Even though the Celtics jumped to a 10 - point lead after the first quarter , the Nets answered and cut the deficit to two points at the break . Both teams went back and forth during the second half , but in the end Boston came on top despite Brooklyn 's attempts to send the game to overtime .

The Celtics ( 48 - 23 ) still retain an outside shot of recapturing the top spot in the Eastern_Conference from the Toronto Raptors , but they 'll have to keep piling up wins to do so . The fact that star point guard Kyrie Irving ( knee ) remains out of commission only makes the task more daunting , but Tuesday 's contest ultimately showed why Boston ca n't be counted out just yet . After a highly entertaining , back - and - forth affair that saw both teams often match each other bucket for bucket , the Thunder ( 43 - 30 ) looked like they 'd finally built an insurmountable 98 - 92 cushion with 25 seconds remaining . No one gave the trio of Jayson Tatum , Terry Rozier and Marcus Morris the memo , however , as they all drained clutch baskets over the final 18 seconds to seal the improbable comeback . Rozier 's 27 - foot three - pointer with 13 seconds remaining followed a free - throw line sequence by Russell Westbrook where he had a key miss on the first of his two shots . The trey left the home squad down only two , and then Carmelo Anthony subsequently missed two more attempts from the charity stripe - - the second of which was rebounded by Tatum . That set up a 26 - footer from Morris that found the net with 1 seconds left and gave the hosts a one - point lead . Westbrook would have one more chance to atone for his earlier misfire , but he hit the front of the rim on his last - gasp three - point attempt at the buzzer . Westbrook led the way for the Thunder with 27 points and added eight rebounds , seven assists and one steal . Paul George posted a 24 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included one assist and one steal . Steven Adams produced 14 points , seven rebounds and two assists .

The Boston Celtics defeated the Brooklyn Nets , 110 - 97 , at TD_Garden on Wednesday . The Celtics ( 55 - 27 ) managed to secure a huge win over the Nets ( 28 - 54 ) as they managed to finish their regular - season campaign on a strong note , and it seems they are ready to take on a postseason path where they appear as one of the favorites to make a deep run in the Eastern_Conference . The Celtics quickly jumped ahead to a 27 - 22 lead in the first quarter , and they extended it both in the second ( 26 - 21 ) and the third quarter ( 30 - 27 ) , so they looked set to close things out with ease . The final 12 minutes of action ended 27 - 27 , so Boston closed things out with a huge 110 - 97 victory that should have them heading into the playoffs riding high on confidence .

Both the Jazz ( 2 - 2 ) and the Clippers ( 30 ) came into Tuesday 's matchup with hopes of continuing their hot starts to the season . Early on , the game seemed to be a competitive one , with multiple lead changes occurring in the first two quarters . The early going saw strong defensive play on both sides , with lock - down centers Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan each impressing . After the start of the second half , however , Blake Griffin and the Clippers ' offense began to run away with the game . Los_Angeles outscored Utah 33 - 15 in the third quarter , thanks to a quick start from Griffin and the rest of the opening unit . Utah began to mount a comeback effort in the fourth , whittling the lead down to single digits , but quickly saw its hopes stamped out by tough play from the Clippers . Star defensive guard , Patrick Beverley , helped put the game out of reach with two clutch steals in the game 's final minutes , and added a dagger three - pointer on the offensive end . Overall , Los_Angeles once again relied heavily on Griffin as an offensive leader . With superstar point guard Chris Paul parting ways with the Clippers this offseason , the highly - skilled Griffin has seen the ball in his hands more than ever over the first three games . On Tuesday , Griffin helped lead the winning effort with a team - high 22 points , as well as eight rebounds and six assists . Griffin turned heads in the first quarter with an emphatic highlight - reel dunk over All-Defense center Rudy Gobert . Another one of LA 's entertaining dunkers , DeAndre Jordan , also impressed with his play . Jordan led the team with 18 rebounds and chipped in 11 points . However , the game marked an unfortunate return to form for Jordan at the free - throw line , where he shot just 1 - of - 4 after having not missed a free - throw in his first two games of the season . Utah , meanwhile , lost control of the game in the second half but still had plenty of positive takeaways from the loss . Rookie wing Donovan Mitchell had a team - best scoring performance , pouring in 19 points and helping to spark the Jazz 's comeback effort in the fourth quarter . Rudy Gobert , meanwhile , looked potent on both ends of the floor , shooting a perfect 5 - of - 5 from the field and rejecting three shots . It appears Utah has yet to find a consistent go - to scorer to replace Gordon Hayward , however , as in each of the first four games a different member of the Jazz led the team in shot attempts . Mitchell was the team 's top shot - taker on Tuesday with 20 field goal attempts . The Jazz will visit Phoenix on Wednesday , while the Clippers see Portland on Thursday .

Miami forged a 34 - 20 lead by the end of the first quarter and took an 89 - 66 advantage into the fourth period . However , the Clippers ( 5 - 4 ) battled back , ultimately racking up 35 points in the final 12 minutes and even taking a 101 - 100 lead with 26 seconds remaining .

The Jazz were relentless on the offensive end until the night 's conclusion , scoring 100 points over the final three quarters of action . All in all , the team enjoyed one of its strongest offensive showings despite the continued absence of injured All-NBA center Rudy Gobert . The Clippers ( 8 - 12 ) have become one of the league 's most severely shorthanded teams this season . Los_Angeles has seen major injuries to both members of its starting backcourt - - Milos Teodosic and Patrick Beverley . More recently , the team lost All-Star big man Blake Griffin to an MCL sprain . The power forward is expected to miss at least two months with the injury . LA was also missing small forward Danilo Gallinari on Thursday , as the newly - acquired wing is nursing a strained left glute . On Thursday , the undermanned Clippers took the court and delivered a respectable offensive showing , shooting a highly - efficient 54 percent from the field and 10 - of - 29 from beyond the arc . The backcourt of Austin Rivers and Lou Williams , both of whom have been thrust into starting roles , combined for 45 points on 15 - of - 30 shooting . No other Clipper scored more than 13 , however , and only four total Clippers finished in double digits for scoring . The lack of overall offensive firepower made it tough for LA to match Utah 's ridiculous offensive onslaught . Utah will host the Pelicans on Friday , while the Clippers will visit Dallas on Saturday .
The Los_Angeles Clippers took down the Phoenix Suns , 108 - 95 , at Staples_Center on Wednesday .

Those struggles were particularly apparent early in the game , as the team scored just 11 points over the first 10:54 of play . While things began to came together more in the second half , Phoenix was unable to whittle away at the double - digit lead that Los_Angeles established early on . With star shooting guard Devin Booker ( groin ) out , the Suns relied heavily on forward T.J. Warren for scoring . Warren finished the game with 22 points and 10 rebounds , but shot an unimpressive 9 - of - 24 from the field in the game .

The Indiana Pacers defeated the Atlanta Hawks , 112 - 87 , at Bankers_Life_Fieldhouse on Friday evening . The Pacers ( 38 - 28 ) came into Friday 's contest with a couple of built - in advantages , one which was clearly the futility of their opponent on the road .

While Friday 's contest ended in regulation , the game excited until the end . The Lakers launched a major fourth - quarter comeback to cut a double - digit lead down to just two points .

The Warriors saw a career night from their rookie center , Jordan Bell . Bell had 20 points and 10 rebounds , along with a block and a steal .

The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Washington Wizards , 130 - 122 , at Capital_One_Arena on Friday night .

Nikola Jokic amazingly compiled a triple - double in the first half and went on to pace the Nuggets with 30 points , 17 assists , 15 rebounds , two blocks and one steal over 34 minutes .

A bloodied Kyrie Irving , victim of an errant elbow , was already headed to the locker room by the 10:10 mark of the first quarter , not to return on this night after entering the concussion protocol . Al Horford never even suited up for the contest due to still being in the recovery process from his own head injury . In other words , the Celtics ' ( 11 - 2 ) odds of extending their league - best winning streak to 11 games appeared dim early on . However , Boston snapped out of its funk after getting blown out in the first quarter by a 26 - 11 margin , chipping away until they 'd clawed all the way back to take an 80 - 79 lead with 5:29 to play . They would extend their advantage to 86 - 81 with 1:30 remaining before the Hornets ( 5 - 7 ) mounted a modest comeback of their own , drawing as close as 88 - 87 with 17 seconds left after a Kemba Walker driving layup . However , that 's when Boston 's trademark defense kicked into gear , as Marcus Morris ' blanket coverage of Walker forced a misfire on a 19 - foot step - back jumper . Terry Rozier was fouled and drained the subsequent pair of free throws , and Jaylen Brown broke up the last - gasp inbounds pass by Charlotte to secure the victory . Walker 's 20 points paced the Hornets , a total he supplemented with 11 assists , five rebounds and one steal . He did n't exactly have the most efficient night , however , making just five of 19 shots from the field . Frank Kaminsky followed with a bench - leading 14 points , which he supplemented with two rebounds and one assist . Dwayne Bacon managed 10 points and four boards . Jeremy Lamb encountered some tough sledding against the Celtics ' stingy backcourt defense , mustering just nine points and adding five rebounds , two assists , one steal and one block . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist supplied eight points , five rebounds and one block while Dwight Howard registered six points but hauled in 11 rebounds . He also dished out three assists and recorded a pair of blocks and a steal . Shane Larkin , who took over for Irving , and Jayson Tatum , who came into the contest battling a sore ankle , co - led Boston with 16 points apiece . Larkin added one rebound , while Tatum brought down a pair of boards and posted an assist . Rozier also saw an expanded role off the second unit and poured in 15 points while adding seven rebounds , four assists and two steals . Morris contributed 14 points and seven rebounds in addition to his stellar defense . Brown pitched in with a 10 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included a steal and a block .

It was the third quarter that made all the difference , however , as the hosts established their superiority with a 41 - point outburst while limiting the visitors to a modest 20 . That gave the Celtics a comfortable 94 - 75 advantage going into the final 12 minutes , and the cushion would turn out to be all they needed to secure their 20th home victory of the campaign . Boston 's biggest advantage came from the field , as they shot an impressive 51 percent , including 46 percent from distance . Taurean Prince led the way for the Hawks with 31 points , a total he supplemented with eight boards , two assists and three steals .

The Celtics remain home and will try to extend their winning streak to four games against the Portland Trail_Blazers in a Sunday matinee as well .
The Boston Celtics defeated the Portland Trail_Blazers , 97 - 96 , at TD_Garden on Sunday afternoon . The Celtics ( 39 - 15 ) and the Trail_Blazers ( 29 - 24 ) played a thrilling game this Sunday , one where the Celtics had to come from behind in the second half to keep their winning run alive . Portland jumped to a 26 - 19 lead in the first quarter , and they increased it to a 16 - point advantage at half time . One would have thought the Blazers would n't have problems to close things out , but Boston came out of nowhere to turn things around . A 31 - 19 win during the third quarter made things close heading into the final 12 minutes , and a 28 - 23 win in the final quarter lifted Boston to a huge one - point win over Portland to keep their winning streak alive . Boston 's streak reached four games , while Portland has dropped their last two . Boston did n't have Kyrie Irving , but Terry Rozier once again delivered as the starter since he finished with 11 poonts , six rebounds and five assists , although he only shot 5 - of - 18 from the field . Al Horford was the team 's top player since he contributed 22 points , 10 rebounds , five assists , and two blocks .

Al-Farouq Aminu added 11 points with eight boards , and Maurice Harkless chipped in with 19 points and eight rebounds off the bench .
The Indiana Pacers defeated the Boston Celtics , 97 - 91 , at TD_Garden on Friday night . The Pacers ( 31 - 25 ) came in with fresh legs courtesy of having seen their scheduled Wednesday night tilt against the Pelicans cancelled due to a roof leak , and their energy was pivotal to them establishing a surprising 30 - 16 first - quarter lead . The Celtics ( 40 - 17 ) gave a slightly better accounting of themselves in the second period , but with Indiana continuing to score , they actually extended their lead to a 21 - point spread by halftime . Boston came out a different team in the third , however , doubling up the visitors by a 34 - 17 margin . That left the hosts with a very manageable 76 - 72 deficit entering the final 12 minutes , setting up an exciting fourth quarter . The Celtics managed to claw all the way back and even forge an 85 - 84 lead with 4:1 remaining , but a 70 run by the Pacers over the subsequent 2:24 gave them enough cushion to secure the hard - fought road victory . Shooting and rebounding were both key to the win - - Indiana shot 45 percent while limiting Boston to a 38 percent figure , and they also won the battle on the glass , 53 - 38 .

The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics,121-99 , at TD_Garden on Sunday afternoon . The Cavaliers ( 33 - 22 ) likely came into Sunday 's showdown riding a modest yet tangible wave of optimism , as not only had they emerged victorious in their previous two games , but they would also be rolling out all of the new pieces they 'd acquired in their flurry of activity at the trade deadline . However , a Celtics ( 40 - 18 ) squad looking to make a statement on their home court on Paul Pierce Tribute Day came out ready to match them bucket for bucket , which helped them forge a 32 - 31 lead after one quarter . Cleveland began separating themselves in the second , however , compiling another 33 points to give them a 64 - 52 halftime advantage . That essentially set the tone for the rest of the contest , and the visitors took an insurmountable 95 - 64 lead into the final period . Three of the newest Cavaliers - - George Hill , Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson - - all contributed double - digit scoring totals in their team debuts , and the second unit compiled 52 points altogether in the blowout . Despite the overall makeover , the Cavs leaderboard still featured a familiar face at the top , as LeBron James led the way with 24 points , 10 assists , eight rebounds , one steal and one block in just 28 minutes . Clarkson followed with a bench - leading 17 points , a total he supplemented with three boards , one assist and two steals . The two - guard duo of J.R.

The Boston Celtics defeated the Memphis Grizzlies , 109 - 98 , at TD_Garden on Monday . The Celtics ( 43 - 19 ) had little to no problem to win this game against a struggling Memphis ( 18 - 41 ) team that ca n't seem to find the right answers on either end of the court right now . Boston quickly raced to a 33 - 24 lead in the first quarter and the game was over from that point as Boston kept increasing the lead against an out - of - form Memphis team that has now lost 10 straight . A 34 - 17 second quarter gave Boston a huge 26 - point lead at the break , and Memphis could n't come back despite the fact they won the remaining two quarters , 28 - 19 and 29 - 23 , respectively . Kyrie Irving was the star of the game after scoring 25 points to go along with six rebounds and five assists . Jaylen Brown added 13 points , and the bench did an impressive job thanks to Marcus Morris ( 13 points , eight boards ) , Terry Rozier ( 13 points ) , and Daniel Theis ( 12 points with seven boards ) .

The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 134 - 106 , at TD_Garden on Wednesday evening . The Celtics ( 44 - 19 ) have been playing with a renewed sense of purpose coming out of the All-Star break , as they 'd notched three straight wins in an attempt to recapture the top spot in the Eastern_Conference from the Toronto Raptors . Typically renowned for some stingy defense , Boston had turned up the heat on offense a notch or two over that span , averaging 113 points . However , their performance Wednesday was on another level altogether , as they put together a 67 - point first half . The Hornets ( 28 - 34 ) did n't exactly lay down , though , compiling 59 points of their own to remain within striking distance . The home squad then came out of intermission firing on all cylinders , as they racked up 36 more points during the third quarter while limiting Charlotte to 20 . That provided more than enough cushion to put it into cruise control in the final period , leading to the 28 - point win . Both teams were impressively careful with the ball while committing just seven turnovers apiece , but the home squad 's 47 - 33 rebounding advantage and 62 percent - 46 percent shooting edge were both instrumental . The Hornets were led by Kemba Walker , who tallied 23 points and added five assists . Dwight Howard , playing through a rib injury , followed with 21 points but turned in an unusually scant three rebounds . He also recorded one steal and one block . Frank Kaminsky provided a bench - leading 16 points and complemented them with three boards and two assists . Michael Carter-Williams supplied an efficient 14 points , two rebounds , two assists , three blocks and one steal in 19 minutes . Jeremy Lamb went for 10 points , two boards and one block .

Marcus Smart delivered a full line of 10 points , six assists , two rebounds and one steal . Jayson Tatum continued a recent downturn with only seven points and three boards .

The Washington Wizards defeated the Boston Celtics in double overtime , 125 - 124 , at TD_Garden on Wednesday evening . The Wizards ( 39 - 30 ) came into the road battle with some confidence , knowing that they 'd forged a solid 19 - 15 record away from their home floor this season . Moreover , there was another factor particularly in their favor Wednesday , as the Celtics ( 46 - 22 ) , were set to take the court without starters Kyrie Irving ( knee ) , Jaylen Brown ( concussion ) and Al Horford ( illness ) , and would also be without the services of Marcus Smart ( thumb ) . However , to their credit , Boston seemed determined to prove their mettle despite the short - handed nature of their roster , taking an impressive 37 - 23 first - quarter lead . The visitors chipped seven points off their deficit in the second period and kept coming in the third , taking a slim 81 - 80 edge in the final 12 minutes . The hosts would regain control and looked to be on their way to sealing a hard - fought victory until a late surge by Washington that culminated in a Jodie Meeks three - pointer with 2 seconds sent the game into overtime knotted at 106 - 106 . In the first extra period , Boston 's Jayson Tatum would play the hero , tying the game at 115 with a driving layup with 3 seconds remaining , although he missed the subsequent free throw , leading to a second five - minute period . In the second overtime , the Celtics left themselves poised to complete a comeback from six points down with 1:25 remaining when Terry Rozier drained a 26 - foot three - pointer with 47 ticks left , but Tatum missed a 28 - foot three - point jumper on Boston 's final possession to send the Wizards home exhausted winners . Bradley Beal led the way for the Wizards with 34 points , a total he supplemented with nine assists , seven rebounds , two steals and one block . MarKieff Morris provided 20 points , seven rebounds and four assists . Otto Porter , Jr. posted an 18 - point , 11 - rebound double - double that also included one assist and three steals . Ian Mahinmi led the bench with a 14 - point , 11 - rebound double - double that also included one assist , one steal and one block .

Terry Rozier tallied 21 points , nine assists , five rebounds , three blocks and two steals . Tatum totaled 19 points , six assists and five rebounds .

The Boston Celtics defeated the Toronto Raptors , 110 - 99 , at TD_Garden on Saturday . In a battle between the top - two teams in the Eastern_Conference , neither club wanted to let up . In fact , neither team led by more than six points until the final five minutes , as there were 20 ties and 15 lead changes in total . Boston really ran away with it late , as they finished the game on an 18 - 7 run after the game was tied with five minutes remaining . In addition , the Celtics rode a 28 - 15 fourth quarter to complete their comeback win . Three-point shooting was the difference in the game , with Boston hitting 7 - of - 17 and Toronto connecting on just 8 - of - 35 . Turnovers were also critical , as the Celtics forced 15 from the Raptors while committing just five on their end . The Raptors ( 55 - 21 ) were led by DeMar DeRozan , as he tallied 32 points , seven rebounds and seven assists on 12 - of - 19 from the field . Serge Ibaka totaled 15 points and 10 rebounds .

The Boston Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls , 111 - 104 , at TD_Garden on Friday evening . The Celtics ( 54 - 25 ) came into the game recently having received the unfortunate news that Kyrie Irving 's knee injury would keep him out through the postseason , which ca n't help but put somewhat of a damper on their overall playoff expectations . Additionally , with their most recent loss to the Toronto Raptors , they pretty much saw their chances of regaining the top spot in the Eastern_Conference evaporate . Therefore , they opted to begin strategically resting some players Friday , sitting both Jayson Tatum and Al Horford . That made for a makeshift starting five , which became even more short - handed when Marcus Morris got the boot for a relatively benign scuffle with Bobby Portis . Despite the absence of anything resembling a normal roster , Boston hung tough , outscoring the Bulls ( 27 - 52 ) by a 56 - 46 margin in the second half to seal the victory . Sean Kilpatrick led the Bulls with 24 points , a total he supplemented with three rebounds and one steal . Lauri Markkanen followed with 20 points and added five rebounds and two assists .

The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Boston Celtics , 112 - 106 , at TD_Garden on Sunday afternoon . The Hawks ( 24 - 57 ) were n't exactly brimming with motivation coming into the contest , considering their absence of postseason aspirations . However , for what it was worth , they were coming off a surprising 103 - 97 victory over the Washington Wizards on Friday night . With a second consecutive Eastern_Conference playoff team on the schedule , Atlanta had a chance to keep generating some late - season momentum . The Celtics ( 54 - 27 ) were n't exactly playing with a sense of urgency given that they 're locked into the No . 2 seed , but they came out and played sharp basketball for three quarters and entered the final period with an 82 - 76 advantage . The visitors mounted a comeback , however , racking up a game - high 36 points over the final 12 minutes to seal the win . Both teams shot well in the high - scoring affair , with the Hawks draining 50 percent of their 86 attempts and Boston posting a 51 percent success rate . Taurean Prince paced the Hawks with 33 points , a total he supplemented with eight rebounds , five assists , one steal and one block .

The host Los_Angeles Clippers demolished the Phoenix Suns , 130 - 88 , at Staples_Center on Saturday . For the second straight game , the Clippers ( 20 ) enjoyed a wire - to - wire blowout victory . The team took the lead in the first quarter and only grew the gap from there , pushing the lead to double digits in the second quarter and starting the second half on a game - clinching run . While Los_Angeles was able to revel in the hefty blowout , the second quarter also saw an unfortunate injury to rookie Milos Teodosic . Teodosic was helped off the floor with an apparent left foot injury and will undergo an MRI to assess its severity soon . Los_Angeles once again benefited from its star power , with All-Star Blake Griffin heading up the offense with 29 points in just 28 minutes of play . Griffin knocked down three three - pointers and made it to the free - throw line 14 times , showing a diverse and efficient offensive arsenal en route to the dominant performance . Fellow All-Star DeAndre Jordan , meanwhile , pulled down a team high of 13 rebounds . Jordan never reached the free - throw line , so the infamously poor foul shooter remains without a missed free - throw in the 2017 - 18 season . Another major story for the Clippers was the continued defensive dominance of Patrick Beverly . Beverly , who made headlines with his stellar defense on rookie Lonzo Ball in Wednesday 's season opener , delivered five steals in Saturday 's blowout win . Phoenix ( 0 - 3 ) , meanwhile , saw a third straight disappointing loss on Saturday . While it paled in comparison to Wednesday 's blowout , the Suns failed to maintain competitive play at any point against the Clippers . The star backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Devin Booker disappointed , combining for only 17 points on 6 - of - 18 shooting . Booker was the only Sun to play more than 30 minutes , as the Clippers ' lead became seemingly insurmountable fairly soon into the second half . Overall , the team struggled significantly on offense , making only six three - pointers while shooting under 40 percent overall from the field . Phoenix will host the Sacramento Kings on Monday , while the Clippers will host the Utah Jazz on Tuesday .
The visiting Golden_State Warriors demolished the Los_Angeles Clippers , 141 - 113 , at Staples_Center on Monday . The defending champion Warriors ( 5 - 3 ) have had a rocky start to the season , but it did not show on Monday . Golden_State faced the league 's top - ranked defense in Los_Angeles and racked up a season - high 141 points . The Warriors made scoring look easy throughout , shooting over 59 percent from the field and pouring in 14 three - pointers . Six of those three - pointers came from two - time MVP Steph Curry , who led the team with 31 points in just 30 minutes of time on the floor . Curry is now averaging just over 28 points per game , leading the scoring - rich Warriors . Former MVP Kevin Durant added 19 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting from the floor . The team finished with six players scoring in double figures and 37 team assists , rounding out what was a tremendous offensive onslaught . Los_Angeles ( 4 - 2 ) entered the game with a league - best defensive rating of 93 . The home crowd would not have guessed it based on Monday 's showing , as the Clippers were thoroughly dismantled throughout the night . While Los_Angeles posted a fine offensive night of its own , shooting 46 percent and scoring 113 points , it was nowhere near enough to bridge the gap with Golden_State . It did not help the Clippers ' case that star forward Blake Griffin had arguably his worst outing of the new season , shooting 4 - of - 10 and finishing with only three rebounds and four assists . The Clippers have now dropped two straight games after a red - hot opening to the season . Los_Angeles will look to bounce back against the league - worst Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday . Golden_State will next see the Spurs in San_Antonio on Thursday night .
The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers , 113 - 104 , at Staples_Center on Saturday afternoon . The Grizzlies ( 6 - 3 ) have enjoyed a reputation for staunch defense over multiple seasons , with good reason . However , they also boast two All-Star level offensive talents in Marc Gasol and Mike Conley . Both players stepped to the forefront to key Saturday 's victory , posting 21 and 22 points , respectively . Memphis had the hot hand overall , posting a 48 percent success rate from the field , including 42 percent from three - point range . Meanwhile , they limited the Clippers ( 5 - 3 ) to an unsightly 15 percent tally from long distance on 26 attempts from behind the arc . Conley added three assists , one rebound and one steal to his team - leading scoring total . Gasol also hauled in six rebounds and dished out one assist . Tyreke Evans , who 's served as an excellent source of scoring off the bench , managed 20 points , four assists and three rebounds . James Ennis III provided 13 points , five rebounds , two assists and one block . Brandan Wright matched Ennis ' scoring total off the bench and added nine rebounds , two assists , four blocks and one steal . Mario Chalmers supplied 12 points , four rebounds , four assists and two steals . Chandler Parsons registered 10 points , four boards , three assists , two steals and two blocks . Blake Griffin spearheaded the Clippers ' attack with 30 points , 11 rebounds , two assists , two steals and one block . Patrick Beverley totaled 23 points , seven rebounds , two assists and one steal . Lou Williams contributed a bench - leading 13 points and added three rebounds , one assist and one steal .

The visiting Philadelphia 76ers took down the struggling Los_Angeles Clippers , 109 - 105 , at Staples_Center on Monday night . Philadelphia ( 7 - 6 ) brought its record back to above .500 after losing two straight on its West Coast road trip . It has been an exciting start to the season for the young Sixers team , as they look to be in the early playoff mix for the first time in over four years . On Monday , the 76ers won a nail - biter , looking poised beyond their years as they grinded out the road win in the game 's final minutes . While star big man Joel Embiid struggled a bit down the stretch , committing multiple fouls and seeing shots blocked , the Sixers ' arsenal of shooters was able to help the team out . Big three - pointers from Robert Covington and former Clipper J.J. Redick helped push the team over the top in the final two minutes . Embiid led the team overall with 32 points , shooting 11 - of - 20 . The sophomore center added a team - high 16 rebounds . Covington , meanwhile , was a key factor for Philly in the win . He scored 31 points and shot 9 - of - 12 from the field , including five three - pointers . The Sixers ' other promising young big man , rookie forward Ben Simmons , scored 22 points and pulled down 12 rebounds . It was ultimately a terrific night for Philadelphia 's young frontcourt , despite facing off against a pair of All-Stars in Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan . Los_Angeles ( 5 - 8 ) has now lost eight of its last nine games , despite starting the season 40 . The Clippers saw relatively strong play on Monday night , hanging in until the game 's final minutes . However , LA 's top two offensive options , Blake Griffin and Lou Williams , both went cold with the game on the line . Griffin threw up two air - balls in the game 's final two minutes , while Williams was unable to find his range from beyond the arc . Still , the duo delivered relatively impressive numbers on the night . Griffin scored 26 points , leading LA 's starters , while Williams scored 31 points off the bench . The sixth man also came away with five steals . The 76ers will stay in Los_Angeles to play the Lakers on Wednesday , while the Clippers will visit Cleveland on Friday .
The host Los_Angeles Clippers defeated their cross - town rivals , the Lakers , 120 - 115 , at Staples_Center on Monday night . The Clippers ( 8 - 11 ) were led by a whopping 42 points from shooting guard Lou Williams . Williams , who has stepped into a starting role following a season - ending injury to Patrick Beverley , shot 12 - of - 21 and an incredible 14 - of - 14 at the free - throw line in Monday 's win . The guard capped off the performance with four points in the final 32 seconds of the game to help seal a Clipper victory . The team - high scoring performance was a season - best for the former sixth man , who played a team - high 38 minutes in the game . Despite the win , it was not all good news on Monday for the Clippers . All-Star forward Blake Griffin left the game in the fourth quarter with a knee injury , which could potentially sideline the big man for future games . The Clippers commented on Griffin 's status post - game , saying it was `` too early to tell `` the severity of the former first overall pick 's injury . The big man had recorded 26 points , 11 rebounds , and six assists before exiting Monday 's action . The Lakers ( 8 - 12 ) , meanwhile , narrowly missed out on a much - needed victory . The Lakers ' own shooting guard , Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , had a scoring outburst of his own . Caldwell-Pope recorded 29 points and also came away with three steals . In addition to KCP 's strong play , the Lakers saw strong play from their bench . The Lakers bench combined for 52 points , including 17 from backup point guard Jordan Clarkson . Clarkson added eight rebounds and five assists . The strong play from Clarkson was much needed , as starting point guard Lonzo Ball struggled in the loss .

The trade netted LA starting - caliber players in Avery Bradley and Tobias Harris , but they had not yet joined the team by Tuesday 's tip - off . Thus , the Clippers were playing shorthanded on Tuesday as they looked to move past their former star . Griffin had spent the last nine years with the Clippers and had earned five All-Star selections during his tenure there . Things got off to a decent start for the new - look Clippers , as they traded baskets with Portland ( 28 - 22 ) for much of the first half . It was a one - possession game until the third quarter , when the Trail_Blazers went on an explosive run to start the second half . Damian Lillard was a key factor in the team 's offense , as he scored 28 points and went a perfect 11 - of - 11 at the free - throw line . Offensive rebounding also proved key . Jusuf Nurkic led Portland with 20 rebounds , seven of which came on the offensive end . The Clippers saw 19 rebounds from their own center , DeAndre Jordan . Only three of those were offensive , though , as second - chance points were few and far between for the Clippers . Perhaps the biggest issue for the Clippers was the sub - par play of sixth man Lou Williams . Williams has had a career year , but on Tuesday , he had one of his worst nights of the season . He shot just 5 - of - 26 from the field and turned the ball over four times . Portland will host the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday .

The Boston Celtics took down the Grizzlies in Memphis on Saturday , 102 - 93 . Boston ( 25 - 7 ) is in the midst of one of its worst stretches of the season , having dropped three of its last five before visiting Memphis . Still , the Eastern_Conference-leading Celtics seemed to have few issues dealing with a struggling Grizzlies team . With Boston on the second half of a back - to - back , head coach Brad Stevens managed minutes carefully , playing only the young duo of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum more than 32 minutes . Tatum made the most of his featured role , scoring 19 points on 7 - of - 13 shooting to go with nine rebounds , two steals , and two blocks . While Tatum 's scoring touch was on full display , it was superstar guard Kyrie Irving who led the Celtics in the points column . Irving notched 20 points on the night , knocking down four three - pointers along the way . Memphis ( 9 - 21 ) is in the midst of a nightmarish stretch , having now lost 16 of its last 18 games . Star point guard Mike Conley ( Achilles ) remains sidelined , and the team has seemingly been unable to respond to his absence . The Grizz rank 29th in the NBA in points per game , and on Sunday , the team 's offensive impotence was apparent . Despite a 30 - point outing for All-Star center Marc Gasol , the team shot only 40 percent from the field in Sunday 's loss . Some of the struggle can be attributed to the efforts of the Celtics ' top - ranked defense , but poor shooting nights have become the norm for the Grizzlies recently as they continue to plummet in the standings . Next up for the Celtics is a trip to Indiana to face the surprisingly strong Pacers . Boston came back from down 12 to beat Indiana in their last matchup , but the Pacers were playing without red - hot shooting guard Victor Oladipo .

The Thunder ( 41 - 29 ) came into the contest with a markedly better record and prospectus than the Hawks ( 20 - 48 ) , but with a reputation for struggling against inferior opponents from time to time as well , especially on the road . Like clockwork , that deficiency seemed to rear its ugly head in the first half , as Atlanta forged an eye - opening 66 - 54 halftime advantage .

The Utah Jazz defeated the Denver Nuggets , 106 - 96 , at Vivint_Smart_Home_Arena on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams . In what proved to be a back - and - forth game , the hard - nosed defense of Utah ( 10 ) prevailed over the up - tempo offense of Denver ( 0 - 1 ) . Both teams were looking to debut a new lineup , as Denver acquired All-Star forward Paul Millsap over the offseason , while Utah dealt with the loss of star wing Gordon Hayward in free agency . Millsap 's first appearance for Denver got off to a solid start , as he picked up two early buckets and helped the Nuggets ' offense score 30 first quarter points . Ten of those points came from versatile bench wing Will Barton , who knocked down two three - pointers near the end of the first to help extend Denver 's lead . Unfortunately for the Nuggets , as the game went on , their offense began to lose steam . The stifling Jazz defense held the Nuggets to just 13 fourth quarter points and forced a field goal drought of over five minutes for Denver 's closing unit . For the Jazz , the season opener marked the Utah debut of two new starters in Ricky Rubio and Donovan Mitchell . Rubio , the former Minnesota point guard , facilitated the offense effectively in his first start with the Jazz , dishing out ten assists . Mitchell , the 13th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft , got the start in his first NBA appearance and tallied ten points despite shooting just 3 - of - 11 from the field . The biggest key to success for the Jazz , though , was First Team All-Defense center Rudy Gobert . Though Gobert committed an unfortunate six turnovers , he led the team with 18 points and pulled down ten rebounds . Denver came into the game with high hopes for the season . In addition to adding Millsap , third - year center Nikola Jokic has developed lofty expectations from fans and analysts thanks to his strong play in the 2016 - 17 season . Jokic showed off his trademark passing on Wednesday , leading the Nuggets with eight assists . However , he disappointed in the scoring column , posting just seven points on 3 - of - 10 shooting . The biggest scoring threat for the Nuggets proved to be sixth man Will Barton , who delivered a scoring spark of 23 points off the bench .

The Thunder ( 1 - 1 ) were held to just 14 points in the first quarter , and superstar and reigning MVP Russell Westbrook was particularly limited . Westbrook managed just three points through the game 's first three quarters and six points on the night . Though OKC mounted somewhat of a comeback effort in the final minutes of the fourth quarter , cutting the lead to single digits , Utah held a fairly solid lead for the majority of the game . Coming into the season , questions were raised about where Utah would find scoring after losing star wing Gordon Hayward in free agency . On Saturday , the Jazz appeared to score by committee , with five players scoring 12 or more .

The host Los_Angeles Lakers handily defeated the Detroit Pistons , 113 - 93 , on Tuesday at Staples_Center . Los_Angeles ( 3 - 4 ) relied on a balanced offensive approach to earn the win . Seven players scored in double figures for LA , with Julius Randle posting a team high of 17 in just 17 minutes of play . Los_Angeles made use of its depth , playing only one player more than 27 minutes in the game .

Big man Larry Nance Jr. contributed four early fast - break points , finishing the game with 14 points and a team - high 12 rebounds . Rookie Lonzo Ball was also effective , scoring 13 points on 6 - of - 13 shooting . The reasonable efficiency was an improvement for Ball , who has struggled with his shooting to open the season . Detroit ( 5 - 3 ) had been among the league 's hottest teams before being blown out in LA . The Pistons fell to third in the East with the loss . Early in the game , turnovers proved an issue for Detroit . With Los_Angeles 's length and athleticism , the lack of motion in the Pistons offense led to a number of intercepted passes that turned into transition points . However , the bigger downfall for Detroit was a lack of aggressiveness around the rim . The Pistons were seemingly unable to get to the line on Tuesday , attempting just two free - throws on the game . The Pistons ' only made free - throw came from Reggie Jackson , who led the team with 18 points and five assists . The Lakers will visit Portland on Thursday , while Detroit will host the Bucks on Friday .

Lopez got the better of his former team in the matchup , scoring a game - high 34 points while also pulling down ten rebounds and blocking three shots . Lopez 's frontcourt production came at an important time for the Lakers , as the team recently lost big man Larry Nance Jr. to a hand fracture that is expected to sideline him for at least four weeks . While L.A. was able to earn the win , it saw another unfortunately poor outing from highly - touted rookie Lonzo Ball . Ball finished the game with just six points on 3 - of - 15 shooting , dropping his overall field goal percentage to just over 30 percent on the season . The reigning second overall pick will hope to improve his shooting as the Lakers go forward . On the Nets ' ( 3 - 6 ) side , D'Angelo Russell did not deliver the showing he may have hoped against his former team . Russell delivered 17 points , seven rebounds , and seven assists , but shot just 8 - of - 24 on the night . The team could have used improved efficiency from Russell , as he shot just 42 percent from the field on the night . Brooklyn also struggled from beyond the arc , shooting just 9 - of - 38 from deep . New addition Allen Crabbe , meanwhile , delivered a team - high 25 points while shooting 6 - of - 11 from the field . Crabbe played just 28 minutes off the bench , but delivered a significant spark to Brooklyn 's offense . Los_Angeles will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday , while the Nets will visit Phoenix on Monday .
The Los_Angeles Lakers defeated the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 107 - 102 at Staples_Center on Sunday . The Lakers ( 5 - 5 ) rode the hot hand of Brandon Ingram through the first half and continued to see efficient play from rookie Kyle Kuzma , as they were able to hold off a late rally by the Grizzlies to come away with the home victory . A slight scare occurred for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope after it looked like he injured his hip , however , a brief stint in the locker room was all it took for the offseason acquisition to return to the floor . Caldwell-Pope went on to log 15 points across 35 minutes . Down 18 points to begin the fourth quarter , Memphis ( 6 - 3 ) brought it within three points with under one minute remaining after a Mike Conley three pointer and a flagrant foul from Brook Lopez put Dillon Brooks on the free throw line . Brooks put Lopez on the free throw line just a few seconds later which iced the game after Marc Gasol missed a three pointer on the ensuing possession . Ingram cooled off in the second half , but still finished with 20 points and seven rebounds on 7 - of - 14 shooting , while Lopez led the team in scoring with 21 points , five assists and two blocks . Jordan Clarkson was the bright spot off a bench that only ran four players deep , as he finished with 15 points , five assists and four boards across 20 minutes . Mike Conley led the way for the Grizzlies starters and added 23 points , five rebounds and three dimes on 9 - of - 17 shooting , while Tyreke Evans led all scorers with 26 points on 10 - of - 16 shooting off the bench . Next up , the Grizzlies will visit the Portland Trail_Blazers on Tuesday , while the Lakers head to Boston to face the Celtics on Wednesday .
The Philadelphia 76ers took down the host Los_Angeles Lakers , 115 - 109 , at Staples_Center on Wednesday . Philadelphia ( 8 - 6 ) was fueled by a monstrous career night from sophomore big man Joel Embiid . Embiid dominated all aspects of the game , finishing with a career - best 46 points to go with 15 rebounds , seven assists , and seven blocked shots . The star center drew non - stop attention from the Los_Angeles defense , earning 19 trips to the line in the game . Embiid scored his points on unbelievable efficiency , shooting 14 - of - 20 from the field and 16 - of - 19 from the free - throw line . Embiid and rookie big man Ben Simmons led the charge for the 76ers , who saw struggles from their perimeter shooters . The team shot only 22 percent from three - point range , but still racked up 115 points on the night and shot 49 percent from the field . Simmons added 18 points , nine rebounds , and ten assists to Philly 's winning effort . Los_Angeles ( 6 - 9 ) saw a relatively strong showing thanks to their own sophomore star . Second-year forward Brandon Ingram led the team with 26 points , 11 rebounds , and two blocks . Rookie Kyle Kuzma added another 24 points while starting alongside Ingram at the other forward slot . The duo shot a combined 20 - of - 36 from the field , bolstering a Lakers offense that hit just 38 percent of its shot overall on the night . A large part of that was rookie point guard Lonzo Ball , who struggled heavily on Wednesday . Ball was forced to sit the fourth quarter due to poor play , as he shot just 1 - of - 9 from the field and committed two turnovers while dishing just two assists . The rookie remains in the bottom five in the league in field goal percentage . Los_Angeles will host the Phoenix Suns on Friday , while Philadelphia hosts the Golden_State Warriors on Saturday .
The Los_Angeles Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls , 103 - 94 , at Staples_Center on Tuesday evening . The battle of two young squads began with a tightly - contested first quarter that the Bulls ( 3 - 12 ) emerged from with a slim 27 - 23 lead . Chicago impressively continued to pour it on in the second , leading to a 56 - 42 halftime edge . However , the Lakers ( 8 - 10 ) seemed to have gotten a wake - up call at intermission , as they exploded for 61 second - half points . In all , the visitors enjoyed a much more balanced effort from their first unit , as each starter posted double - digit scoring . In comparison , the Lakers saw only three first - string players manage the feat , but that was offset by a combined 22 points from Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle off the bench . Both teams notably finished in a 54 - 54 deadlock on the glass for the night . The emerging Denzel Valentine led the way for the Bulls with 17 points , nine rebounds , four assists and two steals . Antonio Blakeney contributed a bench - leading 15 points and supplemented them with two boards and one assist . Robin Lopez posted 14 points , three boards , two assists and one block .

Kris Dunn poured in 12 points and added six assists , five rebounds , one steal and one block . Justin Holiday rounded out the starting five 's impressive night with a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . Kyle Kuzma paced the Lakers with 22 points , a total he complemented with five assists and three rebounds . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope continued to flash much more well - rounded production than he 's been known for thus far in his career , supplying a near double - double of 21 points , nine rebounds , four assists and three steals . Brandon Ingram registered 17 points , five assists , five rebounds , two blocks and one steal . Clarkson tallied 12 points , while Randle , who posted a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also featured two assists and two blocks , scored eight of his points in the pivotal third period . Lonzo Ball continued to struggle from the field ( 3 - 13 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt ) , but he finished with a respectable line of eight points , 13 rebounds , four assists and one steal . Brook Lopez mustered a modest four points but brought down nine rebounds . The Bulls continue their road trip with a visit to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night , while the Lakers tangle with the Sacramento Kings on the road Wednesday as well .
The Houston Rockets demolished the host Los_Angeles Lakers , 118 - 95 , on Sunday night . Houston ( 18 - 4 ) has won seven straight and sits atop the Western_Conference standings , holding a one - game lead on the Golden State Warriors for first place . Since the return of star point guard Chris Paul , the Rockets own the number one offensive and defensive rating in the NBA . On Sunday , the team showcased its abilities on both sides of the ball , shooting over 50 percent while holding LA to just 38 percent from the field . League-leading scorer James Harden had a team - high 36 points on 13 - of - 22 shooting . Harden also dished out nine assists . Two other Rockets guards scored over 20 points , as Chris Paul and Eric Gordon poured in 21 and 22 respectively . As a team , Houston , which is currently shattering the all - time three - point attempts per game record , had 14 three - pointers on 37 attempts . Los_Angeles ( 8 - 15 ) fell to 3 - 10 in its last 13 games with Sunday 's loss . The team struggled to find any offense against the powerhouse Rockets on Sunday , shooting just 38 percent from the field . Still , it was a strong game from rookie forward Kyle Kuzma . Kuzma came off the bench , scoring 22 points and pulling down 12 rebounds . Sophomore Brandon Ingram scored 18 points and came away with nine rebounds and six assists , continuing a strong stretch of play for the former second overall pick . It was not as strong an outing for the reigning second overall pick , Lonzo Ball , who shot 0 - of - 4 and finished the night with just two points and one rebound . Ball now ranks dead last in the league in just about every shooting category , posting just 38 percent true shooting and 25 percent from three - point range . The Lakers will play the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday , while the Rockets will face off against the Utah Jazz .
The Golden_State Warriors took down the Lakers , 116 - 114 , in overtime at Staples_Center on Monday . Both of the matchups between the two teams this season have now been won by Golden_State in OT . While Monday 's action was close until the very end , much of the attention at Staples_Center was not directed towards the players on the floor . Monday night marked the formal retirement of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant 's number 8 and number 24 jerseys , and both teams had a chance to stay out on the floor to watch the festivities at halftime . Bryant , the former MVP , became the first Laker to have multiple jersey numbers retired . The night did not exactly have a storybook ending for Kobe , though , as Kevin Durant and the Warriors ( 24 - 6 ) handed a heartbreaking loss to his former team . With superstar Steph Curry ( ankle ) and defensive stalwart Draymond Green ( rest ) sidelined , Durant carried a heavy workload throughout the night . Things got off to a rocky start for the former MVP , as he began the game just 5 - of - 23 from the field and allowed the Lakers to hold leads as late as the fourth quarter . Durant , though , bounced back in a big way . He hit five of his final six shots and scored 12 points in overtime to put the game away for Golden_State . Durant finished the night with a game - high 36 points and a team - best 11 rebounds and eight assists . The superstar 's performance nearly single - handedly led the Warriors to victory , as the team 's next - highest scorer was Klay Thompson with just 17 points on 6 - of - 24 shooting . Los_Angeles ( 10 - 18 ) may be having flashbacks to its most recent game against Golden_State , another narrow overtime loss at home . Once again , it was young players that allowed the Lakers to push the defending champs to the edge . Rookie forward Kyle Kuzma was the team 's leading scorer , pouring in 28 points on the night . Small forward Brandon Ingram , meanwhile , scored 19 points and hit multiple shots to help tie the game late in regulation . Ultimately , though , the Lakers were unable to contain Durant and could not match the tough effort put up by the Warriors on the boards . The Lakers were out - rebounded 60 - 46 on the night . The Lakers will visit Houston on Wednesday , while Golden_State will host the Memphis Grizzlies .
The Portland Trail_Blazers edged the Los_Angeles Lakers , 95 - 92 , at Staples_Center on Saturday . Portland ( 17 - 16 ) earned a much - needed win thanks to strong crunch - time play . The team was again without star point guard Damian Lillard ( hamstring ) , who likely could have helped the Blazers breathe easier down the stretch . Still , Portland came out on top of what wound up being a one - quarter game , as the two teams entered the fourth tied at 70 . With Lillard out , shooting guard C.J . McCollum took a leading role in the offense , attempting a team - high 23 field goals . It was not McCollum 's best performance , though , as he made just seven of those shots and missed two jumpers in the game 's final minutes . With McCollum struggling , bench wing Mo Harkless stepped up to the plate , scoring a team - high 22 points including a go - ahead and - one basket with just over 20 seconds remaining . Harkless was complemented by another unlikely hero , point guard Shabazz Napier , who exploded for 21 points in the game . The duo helped push a Lillard-less Blazers over the top despite a nerve - wracking final few minutes . Los_Angeles ( 11 - 20 ) lost a heartbreaker on Saturday , with poor late - game shooting making the difference . Shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed multiple three - pointers in the game 's final seconds , giving Portland the chance to pull away with the win . Despite the team 's shooting woes down the stretch , the Lakers saw stellar clutch play from a few of its young stars . Lonzo Ball in particular had a terrific end to the game , coming up with two blocked shots and a three - pointer in the final stretch of the game . Ball finished the night with a double - double , notching 10 points and 11 assists . Still , a win was not in the cards for the Lakers . Poor free - throw shooting was among the factors that cost the team on Saturday , as they went just 12 - of - 20 from the line . The tough performance at the stripe was far from uncharacteristic for LA , as the team ranks last in the league in free - throw percentage at just over 69 percent . The Lakers will host the Timberwolves on Christmas Day , while Portland will square off with the 76ers next Thursday .
The visiting Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers , 121 - 104 , in a Christmas matchup at Staples_Center . Though the final score did not reflect it , it was a back - and - forth game for most of the night . Minnesota ( 21 - 13 ) held only a one - point lead at halftime , but pulled ahead significantly in the fourth quarter . Star center Karl-Anthony Towns helped jump - start the Timberwolves ' run , personally scoring eight points in the first three minutes of the fourth . Towns finished with 21 points and a team - high 10 rebounds . Towns also came up big on the defensive end with three blocks and two steals . Veteran big man Taj Gibson helped close the game out effectively , knocking down a dagger three - pointer with under two minutes remaining . Gibson finished 11 - of - 13 from the field en route to 23 points , tied for the team high with All-Star Jimmy Butler . Los_Angeles ( 11 - 21 ) was shorthanded on Monday , as rookie Lonzo Ball ( shoulder ) , sophomore Brandon Ingram ( quad ) , and veteran Brook Lopez ( ankle ) were all sidelined by injuries . With many of LA 's top scoring options out , rookie forward Kyle Kuzma led the Lakers ' offense , scoring 31 points . Kuzma has been a dominant force for LA recently , scoring 18 or more points in his last seven games . Outside of Kuzma , though , offense was hard to come by for the Lakers . The rest of the team shot just 4 - of - 19 from beyond the arc on the night and reached the free - throw line only seven times . It was a particularly tough night for guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope . Caldwell-Pope , who missed two potential game - saving shots in the Lakers ' last game , shot just 3 - of - 14 from the field in Monday 's loss . On Wednesday , Minnesota will host the Denver Nuggets , while Los_Angeles will host the Memphis Grizzlies .
The Los_Angeles Clippers took down the Los_Angeles Lakers , 121 - 106 , at Staples_Center on Friday night . After a season filled with injuries , the Clippers ( 15 - 19 ) were the healthiest they have been since October on Friday night . All-Star big man Blake Griffin , who missed 11 games with a knee injury , returned to the starting lineup in the game . Griffin did n't skip a beat in his comeback , as he logged 32 minutes of play and led his team with 24 points . His return will certainly have an impact on the Clippers going forward , as they are just 4 - 7 with Griffin out of the lineup this season . The re - vitalized Clippers got off to a hot start on Friday , opening the game on a 90 run and establishing a double - digit lead within the first three minutes of the game . From there , it was smooth sailing for the Clippers , as there was little fluctuation in the team 's well - established lead . Guard Austin Rivers was a spark for his team , scoring 10 of their first 14 points . He finished the night with just 13 , though . Off the bench , sixth man Lou Williams helped maintain the lead , scoring 23 points . On the other hand , the Lakers ( 11 - 23 ) are dealing with a variety of injuries across the roster . Rookie guard Lonzo Ball ( shoulder ) and veteran big man Brook Lopez ( ankle ) both sat out of Friday 's action . Lopez 's stellar three - point shooting would have been appreciated on Friday , as his team had its worst night of the season from three - point territory . The Lakers shot just 3 - of - 19 from beyond the arc on the night . Rookie forward Kyle Kuzma had a particularly poor shooting night , going just 1 - of - 7 from three . He has now hit just two of his last 18 three - point attempts . With the three - ball not falling for the starters and injuries forcing a shallow eight - man rotation , the Lakers were unable to mount much of a comeback effort through the game 's final three quarters . Guard Jordan Clarkson did provide some offense off the bench , scoring a team - high 20 points . Still , it was a wire - to - wire win for the Clippers , who led for all 48 minutes of action . The Clippers will host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday , while the Lakers will visit the Houston Rockets .
The visiting Oklahoma_City Thunder defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers , 133 - 96 , at Staples_Center on Wednesday . Oklahoma_City ( 21 - 17 ) made quick work of the struggling Lakers , jumping out to a double - digit lead in the second quarter and never giving it up . The team 's early offensive onslaught was largely thank to its `` big three `` of Russell Westbrook , Paul George , and Carmelo Anthony . All three scored at least 20 points in the win . Westbrook was particularly dominant , dishing out 12 assists to go with his scoring total despite just 28 minutes of playing time . Center Steven Adams also delivered a solid outing in limited playing time . In just 26 minutes , Adams had 12 points and six rebounds , three of which came on the offensive end . Adams leads the NBA with 5 offensive rebounds per game . Los_Angeles ( 11 - 26 ) owns a league - high eight game losing streak and the worst record in the Western_Conference . On Wednesday , things looked as bleak as ever for the struggling team . The Lakers shot just 41 percent from the field and 9 - of - 15 at the free - throw line in the 37 - point loss . Wednesday 's win did , though , see the return of veteran center Brook Lopez . Lopez had suffered an extended absence due to an ankle sprain , but played 16 minutes off the bench . He had 10 points and five rebounds in his return to action . The team 's high scorer was rookie Kyle Kuzma , who shot 7 - of - 14 en route to 18 points . The Thunder will stay in LA to take on the Clippers on Thursday , while the Lakers will play host to the Charlotte Hornets on Friday .
The Los_Angeles Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks , 132 - 113 , at Staples_Center on Sunday to end a nine - game losing streak . The Lakers ( 12 - 27 ) put the game away with a strong second quarter . Early in the second , LA 's offense got red - hot , allowing the team to go on a whopping 23 - 3 run . Eight points on the run came from rookie point guard Lonzo Ball , who also assisted on multiple baskets during the hot stretch . He finished the game with 13 points on 5 - of - 13 shooting and six assists . Rookie forward Kyle Kuzma also broke a longstanding cold streak to contribute heavily to the team 's second quarter run . He had multiple baskets in the second quarter and shot 6 - of - 12 on the night to score 14 points off the bench . Sophomore forward Brandon Ingram led the team overall with 20 points . Atlanta ( 10 - 29 ) now has the league 's worst record by a two - game margin , despite entering Sunday 's game having gone 3 - 3 in its last six . On Sunday , point guard Dennis Schroder was able to have a strong game despite his team 's lack of success . Schroder scored 27 points and had five assists on the night . The team seemed to struggle without him on the floor creating offense . Backup point guard Malcolm Delaney posted a team - worst plus - minus of - 24 . As a whole , the Hawks shot an inefficient 44 percent on the night . The Hawks will stay in Los_Angeles to play the Clippers on Monday . The Lakers , meanwhile , will host the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday .

The Los_Angeles Lakers took down the Indiana Pacers , 99 - 86 , at Staples_Center on Friday . The Lakers ( 16 - 29 ) became the first team in NBA history to win a game while shooting below 20 percent from the free - throw line . The poor free - throw shooting was on - brand for the Lakers , who rank last in the league in free - throw percentage this season . Despite going a dismal 2 - of - 14 at the charity stripe , the team was fairly potent on the offensive end . LA shot 55 percent from the field and enjoyed a dominant performance from combo guard Jordan Clarkson . Clarkson scored 33 points on 14 - of - 19 shooting from the field .

LA will host the New_York Knicks on Sunday , while the Pacers will visit San_Antonio .
The Los_Angeles Lakers took down the Boston Celtics , 108 - 107 , at Staples_Center on Tuesday . Early on in the game , Boston flexed its top - ranked defense , holding the Lakers to just 15 first - quarter points . Things were especially solid with defensive anchor Al Horford in the game , as the Lakers scored just nine points on 19 percent shooting while the newly - named All-Star was on the floor in the first quarter . Horford subbing out , though , marked a turning point . The Lakers scored 22 points in the next eight minutes of play and regained the lead . While Boston was able to suppress them and take an eight - point lead into the half , LA came out strong in the third quarter and managed to take the lead for much of the remainder of the game . The team 's free - throw woes nearly cost them the game , though , as Boston was able to cut the lead from six points with 26 seconds remaining to just one with 7 seconds left . Luckily for the Lakers , a bad buzzer - beater attempt from Marcus Smart did not fall , and they were able to hang on to the upset . The big story of the night for Los_Angeles ( 18 - 29 ) was Kyle Kuzma , who had a team - high 28 points off the bench in the win . 17 of those points came in the fourth quarter , as the rookie electrified the Staples_Center crowd with a series of clutch three - pointers and flashy passes . Jordan Clarkson joined Kuzma as one of two Lakers to score 20 or more off the bench . He finished with 22 in the game . Boston ( 34 - 14 ) has made its identity on the defensive end this season , but has seen that fall apart somewhat over the last four games . The team is on a four - game losing streak and seemed unable to contain the Lakers on Tuesday night . The saving graces were the team 's two All-Stars , Kyrie Irving and Al Horford . Irving was lights - out late in the game and finished with a game - high 33 points . Horford , who was named an All-Star earlier in the day , finished with 13 points , 12 rebounds , six assists , and two blocks . The Celtics will stay in Los_Angeles to face the Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers , meanwhile , will hit the road to square off with Chicago on Thursday .

After falling to last place in the Western_Conference , Los_Angeles has gone 11 - 4 in its last 15 games and has won seven of nine after Tuesday 's win . The team dominated the second half on Tuesday , with its young wings leading the way . Brandon Ingram had a team - high 26 points , while Josh Hart had a 15 - point , 11 - rebound double - double . The Lakers closed out the game with strong defense , holding Phoenix ( 18 - 37 ) to just 14 fourth quarter points . Five Lakers players scored in double digits , including Ingram and Hart . Forward Julius Randle was the leading scorer for the second unit with 21 points . One of the biggest areas for the Lakers in the win was free - throw shooting . While the team has shot under 70 percent from the line this season , it managed to go 23 - of - 26 from the charity stripe in Tuesday 's win . For Phoenix , meanwhile , nothing came easy on offense . The team shot just 38 percent from the field and had only two players score more than 10 points . One of those players , though , was rookie wing Josh Jackson .

Phoenix will host the San_Antonio Spurs on Wednesday , while the Lakers will host the Oklahoma_City Thunder on Thursday .
The Los_Angeles Lakers took down a shorthanded Oklahoma_City Thunder , 106 - 81 , at Staples_Center on Thursday . With ankle injuries keeping reigning MVP Russell Westbrook and veteran forward Carmelo Anthony out of the lineup , offense was hard to come by for the Thunder ( 31 - 25 ) . This was particularly pronounced in the second half , as OKC scored only 35 points over the third and fourth quarter . The Thunder had an unusually inefficient night , shooting just 36 percent from the floor in the absence of their two stars . The Lakers ( 23 - 31 ) , meanwhile , came out strong in the second half and scored 31 third - quarter points . The team had five double - digit scorers in the win and knocked down 10 three - pointers . The 25 - point win marked their largest margin of victory this season . This was all despite the team being shorthanded following a deadline - day trade . Los_Angeles agreed to ship Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance , Jr. to Cleveland in exchange for Channing Frye , a first - round pick , and former Boston Celtics star Isaiah Thomas . Neither of the Lakers ' new additions were able to join the team for Thursday 's win , but the team earned the easy win nonetheless . LA 's top scorer was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , who had 20 points on 7 - of - 10 shooting . Brandon Ingram scored 19 points and dished out six assists . Julius Randle , whose name was tossed around in trade rumors before the deadline , scored another 17 . For OKC , All-Star forward Paul George had a green light with Westbrook and Anthony absent . George scored a team - high 29 points and attempted 25 shots to get there . While the team missed the majority of its shots , center Steven Adams did provide them with plenty of second chances . He had seven offensive rebounds on the night . The Lakers will visit Dallas on Saturday , while OKC will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday .
The host Los_Angeles Lakers took down the Dallas Mavericks , 124 - 102 , at Staples_Center on Friday . It was a wire - to - wire win for the Lakers ( 24 - 34 ) , who never trailed in the game .

The Lakers shot a phenomenal 52 percent from the field and hit 13 three - pointers in the win . It was a stellar game from recently - acquired point guard Isaiah Thomas .

Sophomore Paskal Siakam delivered a surprisingly strong performance , scoring 20 points while shooting a highly efficient 9 - of - 12 from the floor . With starting center Jonas Valanciunas sitting out the contest due to an ankle injury , the Raptors resorted to smaller lineups , allowing more time for Siakam and the rest of the Raptors ' frontcourt to take the floor .
